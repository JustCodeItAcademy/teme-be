### Algoritmi string-uri

#### 1. Given a List of Maps, write a method to average each of the properties independently. 
Exclude null values from the average in the parameter data. 
Example data: -
[ { "temperature": 44, "humidity": 12 }, { "temperature": 23, "humidity": 34 }, { "temperature": 34 } ,{ "temperature": null }]
The return value should be a single Map containing the averages, e.g.
{"temperature": 21.0,“humidity”: 33}

#### 2. We have a process that imports a set of product codes into a database, however recently we have noticed that several of the codes have not been formatted correctly and due to the age of the system these are not validated before the import.
Implement product code validation
Our import process already reads the file and adds them into the database, however, there is no validation. Create a validation routine that can be called from the existing code.
Product codes
Our product codes are 7 digits long and have the format:
AANNNYY
AA is 2 alpha characters and NNN is 3 numeric characters and together they form the product ID.
YY is the offer suffix.


#### 3. Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

Example 1:

Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true



#### 4. Given a list of words and two words: word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.
Example:
Assume that words =["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].
Input: word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”
Output: 3
Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
Output: 1


#### 5. You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only two characters: + and -, you can flip two consecutive "++" into "--", you can only flip one time. Please find all strings that can be obtained after one flip.

Write a program to find all possible states of the string after one valid move.

Example
Example1

Input:  s = "++++"
Output: 
[
  "--++",
  "+--+",
  "++--"
]
Example2

Input: s = "---+++-+++-+"
Output: 
[
	"---+++-+---+",
	"---+++---+-+",
	"---+---+++-+",
	"-----+-+++-+"
]


#### 6. Given an n x n binary matrix image, flip the image horizontally, then invert it, and return the resulting image.

To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed.

For example, flipping [1,1,0] horizontally results in [0,1,1].
To invert an image means that each 0 is replaced by 1, and each 1 is replaced by 0.

For example, inverting [0,1,1] results in [1,0,0].


#### 7. Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.


Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
Example 3:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.


#### 8. Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.


Example 1:

Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.

Example 2:

Input: g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.

### 9. Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [4,9]
Explanation: [9,4] is also accepted.

### 10. You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

 

Example 1:

Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0
