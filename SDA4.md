### Algoritmi string-uri

#### 1. How do you reverse a given string in place?
#### 2. How do you find duplicate characters from a string? (using map)
#### 3. How do you print the first non-repeated character from a string?
#### 4. How do you reverse words in a given sentence without using any library method?
#### 5. How do you check if a given string is a palindrome?
#### 6. How do you find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters?
#### 7. How do you find the longest palindromic substring in str?
#### 8. Longest common prefix
Given a set of strings, find the longest common prefix.
Examples:

nput: {“geeksforgeeks”, “geeks”, “geek”, “geezer”}
Output: “gee”

Input: {“apple”, “ape”, “april”}
Output: “ap”
#### 9. Group anagrams
Example:
Input: [yo,act,flop,tac,foo,cat,oy,olfp]
Output: the anagrams are grouped: [[yo, oy], [flop, olfp], [act,tac,cat], [foo]]
#### 10. SmordnilapPairs
Given an array, generate the pairs of words that are written in reversed way.
Example:
Input: [diaper, abc, test, cba, repaid]
Output: [[diaper, repaid], [abc, cba]]
#### 11. Check if two strings are permutation of each other
Example: "abcd" si permutation of "cadb" 

### Algoritmi array-uri

#### 1. How do you find the missing number in a given integer array of 1 to n?
#### 2. How do you find the duplicate number on a given integer array?
#### 3. How do you find all pairs of an integer array whose sum is equal to a given number?
#### 4. Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.
#### 6. Best time to buy sell stock
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
#### 7. Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum (de observat Kadane Algorrithm)
#### 8. Search in Rotated Sorted Array (de observat cum se face)
There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).
Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].
Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
#### 9. Container with most water
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

#### 10. Find max sum of subarray of length k 
#### 11. Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.
Example:
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
